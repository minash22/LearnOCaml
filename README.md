# LearnOCaml â€“ A Student-to-Student OCaml Guide by Mina Sharifi

This project is based on my university thesis: a complete, beginner-friendly handbook for learning functional programming with OCaml.  
It was written by me, as both a personal learning journey and a resource to help other students start their OCaml path with clarity and confidence.

The project includes:
-  Chapter-by-chapter `.ml` files matching the structure of the book
- Fully runnable examples with output
- Practice zones with exercises and solutions
-  A final mini project (terminal To-Do app)

Topics covered include: variables, functions, recursion, pattern matching, records, variants, modules, safe code (`option`, `result`), imperative features, and more.

Whether you're new to OCaml or looking for a student-focused perspective, this repo is meant to guide you from your first line of code to a complete working project.
